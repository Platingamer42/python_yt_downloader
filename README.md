1) download this repo
2) have python installed on your machine
3) run installer.bat (just installs yt_dlp and pillow, 2 python-dependencies)
4) run the run.bat (just runs the main.py of this repo)
5) download songs via GUI or scanning the by scanning the urls.txt file (you can add links line-seperated here to make your life easier. Or you could donwload whole playlists)
6) enjoy

Possible troubleshoots: 
program starts but some weird errors are shown: rerun installer.bat, maybe there is a new version of the dependency that fixes your bug
program wont even start, something something about a python: added to path? (google)
program starts and works fine: probably a major bug, pls report immediately
